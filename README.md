This program has the following instructions:

** Part 1: ** We have provided information for the 18 players in the Player Info spreadsheet. Please choose an appropriate data type to store the information for each player. In addition, create an empty collection constant to hold all the players’ data. Once you have decided on what tools to use, manually enter the player data so it can be used in Part 2.

** Part 2: ** Create logic to iterate through all 18 players and assign them to teams such that the number of experienced players on each team are the same. Store each team’s players in its own collection for use in Part 3. Please note: your logic should work correctly regardless of the initial ordering of the players and the number of players. This solution should work if there are 18 players or 100.

Also, if you would like to attain an “exceeds expectations” rating for this project, write code to ensure that each team's average height is within 1.5 inches of the others.

** Part 3: ** Write code that iterates through all three teams of players and generates a personalized letter to the guardians, letting them know which team the child has been placed on and when they should attend their first team team practice. As long as you provide the necessary information (player name, team name, guardian names, practice date/time), feel free to have fun with the content of the letter. The team practice dates/times are as follows:

Dragons - March 17, 1pm
Sharks - March 17, 3pm
Raptors - March 18, 1pm
